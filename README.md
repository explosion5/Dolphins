# Dolphins

This is the main code of [Dolphins](https://dolphins-dataset.net).

Please modify dolphins_generation.py to set your own positions of sensors and the maps.

Thanks for the work: https://github.com/liulingfeng123/Carla0.9.10-kitti-data-export. It helps to export data in KITTI format.

The code has been tested with CARLA 0.9.12
